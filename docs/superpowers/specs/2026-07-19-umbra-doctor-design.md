# `umbra doctor` — design

_2026-07-19. Status: approved, ready for implementation planning._

## Why

On 2026-07-19 a single host fault cost most of a working day. It presented three
different ways as it degraded — under-load native crashes, then guests unreachable
while still reporting `running`, then guests failing to obtain an IP at all — and at
each stage the documented fix for the *previous* stage was retried and failed. Two
unrelated CI failure modes (a GitHub org billing lockout, stale runner registrations)
looked similar enough from the outside to confuse the diagnosis further.

The knowledge to triage this exists, but only as prose in a memory file. `umbra doctor`
encodes it as an executable ladder so recurrence costs minutes instead of hours.

The command is **diagnose-only**. It never mutates state in its default mode. This is
deliberate: the expensive lesson of 2026-07-19 was that applying a fix at the wrong rung
is worse than doing nothing, and the fix at the bottom rung (a hardware power-cycle) is
not something software can perform.

## Architecture

Three units, split so the diagnostic logic is testable without a broken host.

### `cmd/umbra/doctor.go` — evidence collection

All I/O lives in the CLI layer, not in `internal/doctor`. This follows the repo's
existing pattern (`stats.go` and `runner.go` both collect over ssh from `cmd/umbra`) and
keeps `internal/doctor` free of cobra and client plumbing — that purity is what makes
`Classify` testable, so it is worth protecting.

Collected:

- daemon ping (via the existing API client)
- machine list (name, state, IP)
- `~/.umbra/log/umbrad.err.log` scan
- per-guest ssh reachability probe
- per-guest runner systemd unit state
- GitHub runner registration + recent job outcomes, via `gh`

Produces an `Evidence` struct. No interpretation happens here. Every probe failure
degrades that one field rather than aborting — one unreachable guest must not blind the
diagnosis to the rest of the host.

### `internal/doctor` — `Classify(Evidence) Verdict`

A **pure function**. No I/O, no clock, no filesystem. Evidence in, verdict out. This is
where the ladder lives, and being pure is what makes every rung unit-testable with a
literal struct.

`Verdict` carries: matched rung, human-readable reasoning, the supporting evidence, and
the exact next-action command.

### `cmd/umbra/doctor.go`

Thin CLI, mirroring the existing `status.go` shape: `--json` for watchdog probes,
`--deep` for the mutating/expensive probes.

## The ladder

Ordered by blast radius: host-wide faults first, then per-guest, then per-repo.

**Verdict shape.** Rungs 0 and 1 are host-wide and terminate the ladder — if the daemon is
down or netstack is dead, nothing below it can be diagnosed meaningfully, so doctor reports
that single verdict and stops.

**Precedence.** The terminating tiers are evaluated in this order, which is *not* the same
as rung number:

1. **Daemon down** (rung 0) — nothing below can even be collected.
2. **Host hardware** (rung 7) — the two-guest discriminator and the load canary. These are
   live, present-tense observations of the machine miscomputing, and they deliberately
   **outrank rung 1**: rung 1 is inferred from a log, and telling an operator to rebuild
   umbra when the CPU is failing under load sends them down a dead end. When both host
   signals are present they merge into one verdict carrying both evidence strings.
3. **Netstack death** (rung 1) — host-wide, but log-derived, so it yields to tier 2.

Rungs 2–7 are scoped to a guest or a repo, and doctor reports
**one verdict per affected subject**, sorted by rung. A host with a healthy guest and one
stale runner registration therefore prints exactly one rung-5 finding, not a global failure.

The exit code reflects the most severe rung found (0 = all healthy or `unknown`-only,
non-zero otherwise) so the watchdog can consume it.

| # | Rung | Signature | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Daemon down | Ping fails | `umbra daemon install` |
| 1 | Netstack death | ≥2 guests that are each *currently running, currently unreachable, and named by a `guest link <MAC> … cannot receive packets` line in this daemon lifetime* | `make build && make install` |
| 2 | Guest no-IP | state `running`, IP empty | recreate — unless the discriminator says host-level |
| 3 | Guest has IP, ssh won't accept | readiness/ssh timeout | `stop`/`start`, wait for `cloud-init status` = done |
| 4 | Runner service inactive | systemd unit not `active` | restart the unit |
| 5 | Service active, GitHub reports offline | stale registration | `umbra runner add` + delete the stale registration |
| 6 | Billing lockout | jobs fail in ~3s with `runner_name:""` and `steps:[]` | **Ahmad** — org Billing & plans |
| 7 | Idle-healthy but faults under load | `--deep` canary hits SIGILL/SIGSEGV | **power-cycle + Apple Diagnostics** |

Rung 4 is in-guest (systemd, over ssh). Rungs 5–6 are per-repo and depend on `gh`.

### `--deep`

`--deep` opts into the one probe that costs real time. It does **not** start, stop, or
otherwise mutate any machine — see the discriminator note below.

- **Two-guest discriminator** (rung 2): if two guests that are *already running* both fail
  to obtain an IP, the fault is host-level, not guest-image — which rules out a ~20-minute
  recreate in about 2 minutes.

  **Doctor does NOT boot the spare guest.** An earlier draft of this design had `--deep`
  start the stopped spare, probe it, and stop it again. That was deliberately not built,
  for two reasons: it would make `--deep` mutate machine state, and the ops watchdog
  (`ci-runner-guard.sh`) treats the spare being stopped as a steady-state invariant —
  doctor starting it would trip the very alarm doctor exists to explain. The discriminator
  therefore works only with guests that happen to be running already, and reports nothing
  when there is just one. `GuestEvidence.Spare` records *which* machine is the spare; it is
  not a signal that doctor started anything.
- **Native-binary load canary** (rung 7): a bounded ~60s stress — `curl`/`openssl` loops
  plus a parallel CPU burst — watching for SIGILL/SIGSEGV. Stock arm64 binaries taking
  CPU-level signals means the guest is miscomputing, which is a host-level fault that no
  amount of RAM/CPU tuning will fix.

## The stale-log trap

**This is the most likely way doctor gives a confidently wrong answer, so it is called
out explicitly.**

`umbrad.err.log` is append-only across daemon restarts and reboots. At the time of
writing it still contains netstack-death lines from 22:25, on a host that is now healthy.
A naive grep would match those lines and report rung 1 forever.

Three mitigations, all required:

1. The log scanner considers only lines **at or after the current daemon's start
   timestamp**. If the start marker's own timestamp will not parse, the scanner fails
   closed and returns an error rather than silently falling back to an older marker.
2. Rung 1 additionally requires a **live reachability failure**. Log evidence alone never
   convicts.
3. **Correlation, not counting.** `guest link <MAC> closed: cannot receive packets` is
   `level=INFO` and is emitted on **every ordinary guest shutdown** — measured against the
   real log, 7 of 13 daemon lifetimes already carried ≥2 distinct MACs with no fault
   present. So counting MACs is not evidence of anything. A MAC counts only when it belongs
   to a guest that is *right now* running and unreachable, and ≥2 such guests are required.
   Without this, rung 1 degenerates into "any unreachable guest ⇒ rebuild umbra" and makes
   rungs 2 and 3 unreachable in production.

   This correlation needs `GuestEvidence.MAC`, populated from the machine registry
   (`registry.Machine.MAC`, reachable as `MachineView.MAC`). If **no** guest carries a MAC,
   doctor cannot perform the correlation and emits an explicit `unknown` verdict on the
   `unknown` rung saying so — it never convicts on log evidence alone, and never stays
   silent, which would render an unpopulated field as health.

Each of these gets a dedicated test.

## Error handling

When `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or rate-limited, the per-repo rungs report `unknown`
— never `pass`. Silence must not be reportable as health; an absent probe and a passing
probe are different states and are rendered differently.

An `unknown` verdict carries the dedicated **`unknown` rung**, not the rung it failed to
evaluate. "We could not tell" is not the same finding as "the runner is offline", and a
consumer keying remediation off `rung` must not act on a fault that was never diagnosed.
An `unknown` verdict degrades that one rung and lets the rest of the diagnosis continue —
it never terminates the ladder.

Any single probe failing degrades that rung to `unknown` and lets classification continue.
One unreachable guest must not abort the whole diagnosis.

## Testing

- **Table-driven tests over `Classify`** — one case per rung, driven by literal `Evidence`
  structs. This is the bulk of the value and needs no host.
- **The stale-log case** — evidence containing pre-restart netstack lines plus healthy live
  probes must classify as healthy, not rung 1.
- **The discriminator case** — two guests with no IP must classify as host-level, not as
  two independent damaged images.
- **`unknown` propagation** — absent `gh` must not produce a `pass`.
- **Parser tests** over canned `umbrad.err.log` excerpts.
- **CLI smoke test** for flag wiring and `--json` shape.

## Out of scope (YAGNI)

No auto-fix or remediation. No trending or history. No menu-bar surfacing. No
remote-daemon mode. Each was considered and deliberately excluded.
